# Cursor Rules for Statamic CMS Project

## Project Context
This is a Statamic CMS project (Laravel-based flat-file CMS) with Antlers templating, TailwindCSS, and AlpineJS.

## Key Rules

### Always Use CLI Commands
- Use `php please make:block` for new blocks, never create manually
- Use `php please make:set` for new sets, never create manually
- Use `php please delete:block` and `php please delete:set` for removal

### File Naming Conventions
- Antlers templates: `kebab-case.antlers.html`
- YAML fieldsets: `snake_case.yaml`
- PHP classes: `PascalCase.php`
- CSS/JS: `kebab-case.css`, `camelCase.js`

### Component Architecture
- Blocks go in `resources/views/blocks/` (page building)
- Sets go in `resources/views/sets/` (content composition)
- UI components go in `resources/views/components/ui/`
- Partials go in `resources/views/partials/`

### Statamic Patterns
- Use Antlers syntax: `{{ field_name }}`, `{{ if condition }}`, `{{ collection:posts }}`
- Reference existing fieldsets in `resources/fieldsets/`
- Content files are in `content/collections/`
- Always consider flat-file structure (no database)

### Styling Guidelines
- Primary: TailwindCSS utility classes
- Custom styles: Use `@apply` in component CSS files
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use `resources/css/config.css` for custom config

### JavaScript Guidelines
- Use AlpineJS for interactivity
- Keep `x-data` simple and focused
- Place complex logic in separate JS files in `resources/js/`

### Development Workflow
- Start with `composer run dev` for full development stack
- Run `php please stache:warm` after content changes
- Test both development and static generation modes
- Use `npm run build` for production builds

### Code Quality
- Follow PSR-12 for PHP
- Keep Antlers templates minimal and readable
- Use partials for reusable template fragments
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### When Uncertain
- Check AGENTS.md for detailed context
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use Statamic CLI commands over manual file creation
- Remember this is a marketing website (consider SEO)
