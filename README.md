# [Bedrock demo](https://bedrock.remarkable.dev)

## Requirements

Before running Statamic, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). In addition, we recommend [installing Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/).


## Installation instructions

1. Install composer dependencies: `composer install`
2. Install NPM dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a Statamic user: `php please make:user`
4. Next, install the MCP server and coding guidelines: `php artisan boost:install`
5. Start Laravel's local dev server, npm run dev, start queue: `composer run dev`
6. Clear demo content: `php artisan bedrock:demo:clear`

Once you have started the Artisan development server, the website will be accessible in your web browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Head to [http://localhost:8000/cp](http://localhost:8000/cp) and use your email address and password to sign into the Statamic control panel.

## Views folder structure
```
resources/views/
â”œâ”€â”€ blocks/                      # Page building blocks (Replicator fields)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/                  # Project specific reusable components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/                      # Highly-reusable shadcn/ui style Alpine.js components
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ form/                # Form field types (custom Statamic form fields will require a snake_case view file here)
â”œâ”€â”€ partials/                    # Template partials and fragments (things that aren't really reusable go here)
â”œâ”€â”€ posts/                       # Posts collection templates
â”œâ”€â”€ sets/                        # Content sets for Article Block

â””â”€â”€ errors/                      # Error page templates
```

## Tailwind CSS config
- `config.css` - site's config. This file would typically include custom config for the project.
- `typography.css` - the Tailwind CSS typography config for customizing the prose class.

## CLI commands
There is a nice list of custom scripts available in the command line to make a developer's job easier and more enjoyable.

### Blocks
Blocks are like LEGO bricks that provide you the maximum flexibility when building pages. Blocks are based on [Replicator Fieldtype](https://statamic.dev/fieldtypes/replicator).

#### Make
`php please make:block`

- Adds a set to the Blocks field in `resources/fieldsets/blocks.yaml`.
- Creates a fieldset for a block in `resources/fieldsets/{file_name}.yaml`.
- Creates a view with default markup in `resources/views/blocks/{file-name}.blade.php`.

#### Delete
`php please delete:block`

Removes a set from the Blocks field and all associated files.

### Sets
Sets provide a powerful content creation experience with unparalleled flexibility for building entries i.e., Blog posts. Sets live in the the Article field which is based on [Bard Fieldtype](https://statamic.dev/fieldtypes/bard).

#### Make
`php please make:set`

- Adds a set to the Article in `resources/fieldsets/article.yaml`.
- Creates a fieldset for a set in `resources/fieldsets/{file_name}.yaml`.
- Creates a set view with default markup in `resources/views/sets/{file-name}.blade.php`.

#### Delete
`php please delete:set`

Removes a set from the Article and all associated files.

## Production env file contents
Dump your `.env` values here with sensitive data removed. The following is a production example that uses full static caching:

```env

```

## NGINX config
When using full static caching strategy you will need to [configure server rewrite rules](https://statamic.dev/static-caching#nginx).

To enable resource caching add the following to your NGINX config __inside the server block__:
```
expires $expires;
```

And this __outside the server block__:
```
map $sent_http_content_type $expires {
    default    off;
    text/css    max;
    ~image/    max;
    font/woff2    max;
    application/javascript    max;
    application/octet-stream    max;
}
```
